# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze large amounts of data using Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud. The main objectives of this project were to
* Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
* Create training and test groups from a given data set.
* Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
* Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
* Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
* Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
* Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, oversample and undersample machine learning techniques have been incorporated using the RandomOverSampler,SMOTE algorithms and ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm was used.BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were compared that reduce bias, to predict credit risk.
